### This page:
+ See how Jim Smith, Kori Blankenship and Randy Swaty attempted to modernize some BpS models
+ Explore example models--then ask yourself "did they do a good job?"

## Context time
The models below are example models aimed at illustrating modification methods. They are not intended to be realistic ecological models…they are for illustration purposes. We hope that users will primarily use our models to learn, but also assume some people could be tempted to use them as “starter models”.  We’d rather they not do that as we are not experts in the actual ecosystems. We hope they serve to say "wow, these models are highly customizable".

## As you explore these models...
Ask yourself questions such as:

* Do these model modifications apply to my ecosystems?
* Could there be unintended consequences from these changes that trickle through the model?
* Do these modifications make the model more "realistic" or do they more serve to document new transitions that need more research or ???

## Three examples

### Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Oak Forest and Woodland-Jim Smith

**Model Identifier**
Note that the modifications illustrated in this example were applied to a locally-modified LANDFIRE BpS model 13670_32_44, Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Oak Forest and Woodland. You do not have to begin the modification process with a LANDFIRE model. You can utilize any model that serves as a useful starting point for your project.

**Original Model Description**
This BpS is found on drier sites primarily on south and west aspects or ridgetops. It is dominated by shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), oaks (Quercus spp.), and hickories (Carya spp.).

**Modification Goal**
Evaluate the impact of common management practices aimed at restoring this ecosystem to a more native state within the context of today’s management and climate environment. 

**Model Modification Steps**
* Began with the Shlisky Pine/Oak model (not a LANDFIRE Reference Condition Model)
* Runs = 100 because it is a management scenario (left as is)
* Initial conditions = LF Reference Conditions (left as is). They used actual acreage of the type divided by number of cells to create a cell size of interest
* No difference in prob transitions between Ref Con and Working Model x/c additional management added with no probability.
* Added these management actions
    * 2% seed tree in Late Closed 1 and Late Open 1 (both to Early All 1)  to mimic 50 year seed tree regeneration cut
    * 4% commercial thin in Mid Closed 1 to Mid Open 1 and Late Closed 1 to Late Open 1 to mimic 25 year commercial thin
    * Reduced Replacement Fire occurrence using a 0.5 multiplier to mimic increased fire suppression/reduced fire occurrence
    * Using 2.0 multiplier to for Wind/Weather/Stress to double the impact of ice, wind susceptibility in current climate
    * Reduced Surface Fire occurrence using a 0.4 multiplier to mimic reduced fire management
