## State-and-Transition-Modeling in Real Life: A 3-Part Miniseries 

When: June 2021 | In this 3-part modeling miniseries, we will take a wide-ranging look at State-and-Transition-Simulation-Models (STSMs) and use the LANDFIRE BpS models as a launching point for inquiry about ecosystem change over time. We will communicate practical ways to use STSM in real-life research, management and academia. There will be 15-20 min at the end of each section for Q & A.  
 
[WATCH](https://youtu.be/MRPlzP5Ef5U){target='blank'} - Part 1: Kori Blankenship (LANDFIRE Fire Ecologist) will discuss the basics of (STSMs), introduce the LANDFIRE BpS models and share resources for both novice and intermediate state-and-transition modelers.  
 
[WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeFg40vQU9k&t=0s){target='blank'} - Part 2: Leonardo Frid (Systems Ecologist at Apex Resource Management Solutions) will showcase real-life STSM applications with the ST-Sim package for SyncroSim, demonstrate how to use both the Graphical User Interface and rsyncrosim R package and discuss different approaches for applying state and transition modeling tools in real-life management scenarios. 
 
[WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ybz75H9YXg&t=0s){target='blank'} - Part 3: Randy Swaty (LANDFIRE Ecologist) & Dr. Priscilla Nyamai (Asst. Professor, Grand Valley State Univ.) will discuss how integrating STSMs in the classroom can be useful for conceptualizing ecosystem changes.

## Access Free Training

[Apex RMS](https://apexrms.com/){target='blank'} is offering a [free, two-day self-directed online course](https://apexrms.com/st-sim-course-details/){target='blank'} that will provide:

>"...a foundation for developing and running state-and-transition simulation models of landscape change using the free ST-Sim software. The course covers state-and-transition simulation modeling concepts, how to use ST-Sim to create models of landscape change and terrestrial carbon dynamics, and how to run the models and interpret the results."
