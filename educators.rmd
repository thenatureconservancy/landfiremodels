## Using SyncroSim in the post-secondary classroom: A collaboration with Dr. Priscilla Nyamai

The following resources can be used to support the publication “Demystifying ecological modeling: a hands-on activity to acquaint students with modeling ecosystem responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances” *(in prep June 2024).*

This paper describes a framework for post-secondary instructors as they teach ecological modeling to college level students. The authors propose that students can enhance their ecological learning objectives, improve ecological literacy, and gain a deeper understanding of the role of ecological and anthropogenic perturbations in the environment by utilizing these hands-on creative modeling tools.


The idea of ecological modeling can be an intimidating subject to learn (and in some cases teach). For that reason, we have provided this page as a one-stop-shop for anyone interested in starting this learning process.

### Access Free Training

[Apex RMS](https://apexrms.com/){target='blank'} is offering a [free, two-day self-directed online course](https://apexrms.com/st-sim-course-details/){target='blank'} that will provide:

>"...a foundation for developing and running state-and-transition simulation models of landscape change using the free ST-Sim software. The course covers state-and-transition simulation modeling concepts, how to use ST-Sim to create models of landscape change and terrestrial carbon dynamics, and how to run the models and interpret the results."
