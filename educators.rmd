## State-and-Transition-Modeling in Real Life: A 3-Part Miniseries 

In this 3-part modeling miniseries, we will took a wide-ranging look at State-and-Transition-Simulation-Models (STSMs) and the LANDFIRE BpS models. We communicated practical ways to use STSM in real-life research, management and academia. 

Part 1: Kori Blankenship, Fire Ecologist, The Nature Conservancy

## Access Free Training

[Apex RMS](https://apexrms.com/){target='blank'} is offering a [free, two-day self-directed online course](https://apexrms.com/st-sim-course-details/){target='blank'} that will provide:

>"...a foundation for developing and running state-and-transition simulation models of landscape change using the free ST-Sim software. The course covers state-and-transition simulation modeling concepts, how to use ST-Sim to create models of landscape change and terrestrial carbon dynamics, and how to run the models and interpret the results."
