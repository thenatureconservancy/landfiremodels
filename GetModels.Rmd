### This page:
* Get a description and model by:
    + understanding and finding your Map Zone
    + downloading a BpS description
    + loading a model into SyncroSim
    
We will walk through the process with the Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe Biophysical Setting of the Northwestern United States.  **This ecosystem will be the subject of later tutorials**. 


### Understand and find your Map Zone

First you need to know that there are hundreds of Biophysical Settings in the United States, and some of them occur in more than one Map Zone. What is a Map Zone? It's basically a product delivery and summary polygon. The polygons are from the [National Landcover Database Program](see https://www.mrlc.gov/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-2016).  

Pan, zoom, scroll to your area of interest, then hover over the Map Zone you need the number for. A tooltip will pop up with that info. Take note of it for the next step. 

**For our Montane Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem example we are looking in eastern Oregon, or Map Zone 9.**

### Download a BpS Description
Visit the [site description page](http://landfirereview.org/search.php) to search for and retrieve LANDFIRE BpS model descriptions.  

Download the [Montane Sagebrush Steppe Ecosystem description](http://landfirereview.org/search.php?q=Montane%20Sage%20Steppe&hPP=20&idx=lf_landfire_dev&p=0&is_v=1) from [www.http://landfirereview.org/search.php](http://landfirereview.org/search.php). This ecosystem covers Map Zone 9.

### Load your model
Once you have SyncroSim installed, and the LANDFIRE Package loaded, you will go through a few steps to isolate one model to work with. 

**You can view and print the instructions [here](./isolateModel.html).**

Some features of SyncroSim may be different than what you see in the video due to versioning.
