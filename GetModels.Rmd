* Get a description and model by:
    + Understanding and finding your Map Zone
    + Downloading a BpS description
    + Loading a model into SyncroSim (*see and ideally print special instructions*)
    
<br>
We will walk through the process with the **Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe** Biophysical Setting of the northwestern United States. This ecosystem will be the subject of later tutorials. 


### Understand and find your Map Zone

First you need to know that there are hundreds of Biophysical Settings in the United States, and some of them occur in more than one Map Zone. What is a Map Zone? It's basically a product delivery and summary polygon. The polygons are from the [National Landcover Database Program](https://www.mrlc.gov/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-2016){target='blank'}.  

In the map below, pan, zoom, scroll to your area of interest, then hover over the Map Zone you need the number for. A tooltip will pop up with that info. Take note of it for the next step. 

**For the Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe example, scroll to eastern Oregon, Map Zone 9.**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(title = "My embedded document", src = "leafletSIM2carto.html", frameborder = "0", width = "100%", height="400")
```

### Download a BpS Description
Visit the [LANDFIRE BpS Download](http://landfirereview.org/search.php){target='blank'} to search for and retrieve LANDFIRE BpS models and descriptions. Download the [Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe description](http://landfirereview.org/search.php?q=Inter-Mountain%20Basins%20Montane%20Sagebrush%20Steppe&hPP=20&idx=lf_landfire_dev&p=0&is_v=1){target='blank'} for Map Zones 6, 12, 17, 18, 28.

### Isolate and load your model
Once you have SyncroSim installed [(see STSM tab)](./stms.html){target='blank'} and both ST-Sim and lfvegmodels packages loaded, you will want to isolate one (of the ~ 900) BpS models to work with. The lfvegmodels package loads all of the models into your SyncroSim environment -- you do not need to work with all 900 models (though that is possible)!
