*Working, content, graphics, Randy Video: modifying and inserting disturbances into the model*

### This page:

+ Introduces some basic changes you can make to a model
    + change probability in one state
    + make a "global" change to one disturbance
    + add or delete a state
    + add a disturbance
+ Sets the stage for climate change and other modeling

These techniques will get you far in your quest to represent current conditions and/or explore the future. We also hope that while in the various screens you see other options that catch your eye.

## Modifying a reference condition model
Within SyncroSim there are a wide range of techniques available to modify a model. Here we introduce the main ways for modifying a model while working through the montane sagebrush steppe example obtained from the [Get Models](./Getmodels.html) page.  

### Change the probability of a disturbance in one state class
A key starting point in modifying a model is to **change disturbances**.  There are multiple methods for this including changing them one at a time, per state class. Here we will show you how to change the **replacement fire probability** in one class.

### Change the probability of a disturbance across the entire model
While getting to know your models we recommend changing one parameter at a time. This will allow you to get a feel for how it works, and for the sensitivities to adjust to various changes. That said, there are times where you may make "global" changes to the model. For example, you may "turn off" all fires as a way to explore impacts of **fire suppression**. Or, you may not have perfect fire suppression, but suppress 90% of all fires. Instead of changing one fire transition at a time we will show you how to use **transition multipliers** to modify a type of transition everywhere it occurs in the model in a few easy steps.

### Introduce a new disturbance
There are many new **transitions** on the landscape today including exotic pests, multiple types of logging and tree planting. Here we will show you how to add in a new **probabilistic transition**.

### Add a new state 
New and/or altered transitions often result in **new states**. For example, in the Great Lakes combinations of modern transitions have resulted in what some call "maple monocultures". These are forests that would typically have 5+ species represented, but now generally have one, sugar maple. Here we demonstrate how to **add a state**.

### Delete a state
Occasionally, because of natural factors (e.g., an exotic pest) or user error you may want to **delete an entire state**. Here we will show you how to do that.
