*Working, content, graphics, Randy Video: modifying and inserting disturbances into the model*

### On this page you will find:
+ Guidance on making some key changes to a reference condition model such as adding a state class (e.g., for an "invasives" state) and changing disturbances (e.g., altered fire regime)
+ Detailed information on how our Sage Steppe model was modified to represent current conditions
+ And hopefully some inspiration to try out your own modifications!

## Modifying a reference condition model
Within SyncroSim there are a wide range of techniques available to modify a model.  We will not cover all techniques here, but will introduce major ones in separate videos.  We recommend that you download and print the instructions that accompany each video:

* Change the probability of a disturbance in one state class.  https://youtu.be/t3j7aX5os30
* Change the probability of a disturbance across the entire model
* Introduce a new disturbance
* Add a new state 
* Delete a state

These techniques will get you far in your quest to represent current conditions and/or explore the future.  We also hope that while in the various screens you see other options that catch your eye.
