## Welcome

Hello and welcome to The Nature Conservancy's LANDFIRE vegetation dynamics modeling site. We created this site to help you harness the potential of the vegetation dynamics modeling framework to accomplish your analysis, management, and restoration objectives. We recognize the importance of having the best resources to accomplish your goals and LANDFIRE is continually improving our products to get you the tools and data that you need.
<br>

**How to use this website?** We designed this website as a resource for both new and seasoned Biophysical Setting (BpS) modelers. We use the Montane Sage-Steppe ecosystem model throughout the website. By weaving this model into all the tutorials, we can dive deeper into exploring, modifying, and understanding the model’s “story”. We hope you find our website useful and most importantly, we hope you use these BpS models to their fullest extent. 

If you are already familiar with this modeling framework and ready to **get started,** skip ahead to [get your models](./GetModels.html).

## Why integrate this into your current work?

This framework provides a **national baseline** for assessing **current** vegetation conditions while accounting for **historical** ecology. Integrating this knowledge with current projections of climate and other factors has the potential to improve the way we manage land while providing ecological context. This modeling framework can help you make projections about
future landscape conditions as management and natural environments evolve. When used within the intended context, BpS modeling can be a powerful tool for managers. 

>Biophysical models help users investigate the effects from (simulated) ecosystem disturbances, and learn how changes in management actions might impact an ecosystem **before** allocating time or resources to on the ground operations

## What will you learn?

1. We demonstrate the flexible software environment, [**SyncroSim**](https://syncrosim.com/){target='blank'} which allows users to explore and manipulate LANDFIRE's vegetation dynamics models

2. We illustrate how LANDFIRE’s vegetation dynamics models can be used to investigate **historical vegetation dynamics** and use these historical models to jumpstart your exploration into current and possible future landscape conditions in your area of interest

3. We explore options for **modifying vegetation models** to represent current or projected future landscape conditions

4. We introduce techniques for accounting for **climate change impacts** in the LANDFIRE vegetation models
