## How does vegetation vary on the landscape? How do we figure it out? 
LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings models and descriptions provide a *framework* for exploring these questions, and for testing potential management strategies before trying them on the ground.  
<br>

## What will you find on this website?
A process and resources that will facilitate use of LANDFIRE BpS models and the free sofware SyncroSim.
