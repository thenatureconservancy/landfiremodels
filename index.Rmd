### On this website you will find: 

1. A guide for using LANDFIRE's biophysical settings models (BpS)

2. Tutorials on how to use BpS models and the free modeling software, SyncroSim

3. Examples of how to manipulate the models to suite your specific needs
<br>

### Why model?  
#### Modeling biophysical models provide a framework for:  

1. Simulating disturbances and testing potential management strategies  

2. Modeling vegetation characteristics on the landscape  
3. Making predictions of future landscape conditions
