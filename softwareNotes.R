# quick note--what do users need to do software/package wise, and where do we have the instructions?

### Get SyncroSim
# On STSM page.  Looks good.

### ST-Sim Package
# Two options look good-could add more instructions for Option 2--what do you do once you have downloaded?

### LANDFIRE Vegmodels
# Add to STSM page?
