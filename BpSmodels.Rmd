## Background knowledge

Starting in 2005 the LANDFIRE program (www.landfire.gov) started the development of Biophysical Settings and models.  These products represent ecosystems under natural disturbance regimes, capturing how they "looked" (e.g., structure and composition) and "functioned" (e.g., succession and disturbances).  The descriptions are text; the models are in the software SyncroSim (https://syncrosim.com/).

<br>

### What is LANDFIRE and why did they create these models.  
LANDFIRE is a multi-partner program that "provides 20+ national geo-spatial layers (e.g. vegetation, fuel, disturbance, etc.), databases, and ecological models that are available to the public for the US and insular areas" (from www.landfire.gov).  For you, the modeler some important points about LANDFIRE include:


```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics('15Oct19.jpg')
```



* covers all lands in the United States including the insular islands
* delivers products covering "historical" (just prior to major European settlement) and "current" time periods.  
* not all products cover both time periods-which is why you are here!  The LANDFIRE models only cover historical.  Bringing them up to current might be one of your tasks.
* Some products are delivered by "Map Zone" (see map).
