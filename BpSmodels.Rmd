## Background knowledge
<br>
### Get to Know LF BpS STM Models and Descriptions
<br>
### What is LANDFIRE and why did they create these models.  Map Zones (map?)
Maybe a nice looking diagram (would this be where we put an interactive image? This would be an image of a model in syncrosim)
<br>

### What do the models represent (historic)
<br>
### What are they and how are they linked (model and description)
<br>
### Application scale of the models
<br>
