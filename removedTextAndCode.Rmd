One of the goals of LANDFIRE was to understand the condition of our ecosystems. The metric they created for this is called **"Vegetation Departure" (VDep)**. 

>**Vegetation departure** compares current vegetation structure and composition to "reference" structure and composition.

<div class = "blue">

[**LANDFIRE Vegetation Departure (VDep)**](https://www.landfire.gov/vdep.php) indicates how different current vegetation on a landscape is from estimated reference conditions. VDep is based on:

* changes to species composition
* structural stage, 
* canopy closure (using methods originally described in the [Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook (IFRCC))](https://www.landfire.gov/frcc/documents/FRCC_Guidebook_2010_final.pdf). 

**VDep vs. Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook approach**

* [LANDFIRE VDep](https://www.landfire.gov/vdep.php) is based only on departure of current vegetation conditions from reference vegetation conditions
* [IFRCC Guidebook](https://www.landfire.gov/frcc/documents/FRCC_Guidebook_2010_final.pdf) approach includes departure of current fire regimes from those of the reference period
